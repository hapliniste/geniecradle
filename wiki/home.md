# Welcome to the GenieCradle Project Wiki

Welcome to the hub of "GenieCradle," your go-to platform for shaping and guiding powerful Language Models (LLMs). Building upon the mighty foundation of Exllama, the fastest runner for Llama models, "GenieCradle" offers an intuitive and adaptable tool for AI-driven tasks that provide extensive control and guidance over AI outputs.

"GenieCradle" is designed to function with a range of LLMs, from 7B to 65B parameters, and their various fine-tuned versions available in the open-source domain. The objective is to serve as the cradle for all future AI applications, facilitating a guidance-driven LLM system and a framework that evolves with time and requirements.

## Project planning

- 2023.07.01: Initial project creation
- 2023.07.02: Make an example of generation with atrous text, complete wiki and planning, look at how to add logit bias

## Project Goals

1. **Guidance-Driven LLM**: The unique "Guidance" mechanism allows LLMs to follow a script, fill holes in prompts, and select words from predefined options, improving predictability and control over AI outputs.

2. **Evolutive Design**: "GenieCradle" is not limited to Llama models. Its evolutive nature allows it to incorporate other language models like GPT and those hosted on Google Cloud in the future.

3. **Data Connectivity**: With a powerful embedding search, "GenieCradle" enables seamless connection to local files and databases, making data accessibility swift and effortless.

4. **Agent Flows**: Implementing various "Agent" flows allows functionalities like problem-solving through hierarchical problem destructuring and much more, creating dynamic workflows for diverse requirements.

5. **Usability and Control**: The focus is on usability and control, giving users the flexibility to adjust and fine-tune their AI models as per the tasks' requirements.

6. **Rapid Development**: "GenieCradle" aims to speed up development time by providing an efficient framework for connecting data and defining LLMs and agents faster than current methodologies.
